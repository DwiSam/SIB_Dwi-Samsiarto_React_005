                <p>In addition to being an assistant in the information retrieval laboratory 
                    and also still has obligations as a student. I am also interested in exploring 
                    the countryside where the atmosphere is still cool.
                </p>
                <p>And, I also really like to learn new things, especially in the front end, 
                    ui/ux, and graphic design.
